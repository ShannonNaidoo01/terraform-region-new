Explanation of the Code
Terraform Backend Configuration:

The terraform block configures the backend to use Azure Resource Manager (azurerm) for storing the Terraform state. It specifies the resource group, storage account, container, and key for the state file.
Required Providers:

The required_providers block specifies that the azurerm provider is required, with a version constraint of ~> 4.0.
Provider Configuration:

The provider "azurerm" block configures the Azure Resource Manager provider with default features.
Variables:

allowed_locations: A list of allowed locations where resources can be deployed.
subscription_id: The ID of the Azure subscription where the policy will be applied.
Local File Data Source:

The data "local_file" "deny_locations_policy" block reads the policy JSON file from the specified path.
Policy Definition:

The resource "azurerm_policy_definition" "deny_locations" block defines a custom policy that denies deployments to any location not listed in the allowed_locations variable. The policy rule is encoded in JSON format using the jsonencode function.
Policy Assignment:

The resource "azurerm_subscription_policy_assignment" "location_policy" block assigns the policy to the specified Azure subscription.
Policy Behavior
The policy defined in this configuration will deny any deployments to regions not listed in the allowed_locations variable. This ensures that resources can only be deployed to the specified allowed regions, enforcing compliance with organizational policies. The policy is applied at the subscription



# Terraform Configuration for Azure Policy

## Explanation of the Code

### Terraform Backend Configuration

The `terraform` block configures the backend to use Azure Resource Manager (azurerm) for storing the Terraform state. It specifies the resource group, storage account, container, and key for the state file.

### Required Providers

The `required_providers` block specifies that the `azurerm` provider is required, with a version constraint of `~> 4.0`.

### Provider Configuration

The `provider "azurerm"` block configures the Azure Resource Manager provider with default features.

### Variables

- `allowed_locations`: A list of allowed locations where resources can be deployed.
- `subscription_id`: The ID of the Azure subscription where the policy will be applied.

### Local File Data Source

The `data "local_file" "deny_locations_policy"` block reads the policy JSON file from the specified path.

### Policy Definition

The `resource "azurerm_policy_definition" "deny_locations"` block defines a custom policy that denies deployments to any location not listed in the `allowed_locations` variable. The policy rule is encoded in JSON format using the `jsonencode` function.

### Policy Assignment

The `resource "azurerm_subscription_policy_assignment" "location_policy"` block assigns the policy to the specified Azure subscription.

### Policy Behavior

The policy defined in this configuration will deny any deployments to regions not listed in the `allowed_locations` variable. This ensures that resources can only be deployed to the specified allowed regions, enforcing compliance with organizational policies. The policy is applied at the subscription level, affecting all resources within the subscription.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required Azure resources (resource group, storage account, and container) set up for storing the Terraform state.
2. Update the `denylocation.tfvars` file with the list of allowed locations.
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the configuration.
4. Run `terraform apply` to apply the configuration and enforce the policy.

## Example `denylocation.tfvars`

```terraform
allowed_locations = [
  "canadacentral",
  "europecentral",
  "europewest",
  "southamericaeast",
  "eastus"
]
